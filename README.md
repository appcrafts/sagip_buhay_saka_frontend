What is Sagip ?

SAGIP Buhay at Saka is a short messaging service (SMS) providing climate-based warning services to men and women farmers, 
fishers and to other agriculture-fisheries stakeholders. These warnings, weather and climate information come 
from PAGASA and the local government to help farmers manage climate risks and help reduce losses and damages to 
life, livelihoods and community assets.
